//input - file list of pokemon names (seperated by a new line) and logs each pokemon's types
//according to the pokeapi.co API

//output - Pokemon's types

//Constraints - none

//Edge Cases - pokemon name might not be in API, user error - typo
 //-----------------------------------------------------------------

//Pseudocode
//reads from a file while converting contents of each line to a string

//take the array and convert to JSON

//loop through elements of the array
//pass each element to a function that fetches each the name of the pokemon
//from there, retrieve their type, and append it to the passed in file
